This is a re-creation of pong, one of the first game of https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/

Menu/pause key is 'Esc'.

Play it here: https://xyloph.github.io/20GC_Game1/

Note that on the web export, the sound doesn't start right away, and sometimes the ball appear centered and the game in the top left. Refresh should fix that. Haven't figured that out yet.
